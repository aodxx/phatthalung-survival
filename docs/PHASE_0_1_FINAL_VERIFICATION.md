# PHASE 0/1 FINAL VERIFICATION

วันที่ตรวจ: **2026-08-20** ตามเวลางานของโครงการ ตรวจบน preview HTTPS ของ `phatthalung-survival` โดยใช้ข้อมูล TEST-only เท่านั้น

## Executive decision

> **ผลตัดสิน: CONDITIONAL — ยังไม่ formally exit Phase 0/1 และยังไม่เริ่ม implementation ของ Phase 2**

Foundation และ Citizen Intake มีหลักฐานผ่านในส่วน atomic acknowledgement, idempotency, RLS zone authorization, public tracking boundary, attachment storage boundary และ PWA shell. TEST attachment rows และ dependent request/audit data ถูก cleanup แบบ fail-closed แล้ว และ post-cleanup counts เป็นศูนย์. Offline reload และ published-route smoke ผ่านแล้ว แต่ยังไม่ได้รัน full preview matrix ทุกเส้นทางและยังไม่มี owner sign-off สำหรับ formal exit. ตามหลัก Blueprint/PRD จึงยังไม่ควรประกาศ READY FOR PHASE 2 แบบไม่มีเงื่อนไข แม้เอกสารออกแบบ Phase 2 จะถูกจัดทำไว้แล้วก็ตาม

## Changes delivered in this fixing pass

The client now coordinates both offline queues through IndexedDB schema version 3. Each queue’s upgrade handler creates both object stores, so an existing version-1 or version-2 database can be upgraded regardless of which queue opens first. A regression suite protects this behavior.

The active Supabase schema now includes a full unique index on `public.attachments(client_attachment_id)`, recorded in `supabase/migrations/20260820000012_attachments_client_attachment_id_unique_full.sql` and applied to project `ulawoqswzqfpqyssxggn`. This matches the server’s atomic retry upsert contract. The earlier partial index was insufficient for PostgreSQL conflict-target inference.

The runtime evidence file `docs/RUNTIME_SMOKE_EVIDENCE.md` now records TEST attachment READY, tracking metadata, authorized download, PWA controller/cache, and the remaining limitations. No tracking token, secret, or real PII is included.

## Required closing actions before formal exit

First, run the remaining controlled preview matrix for Intake, GPS fallback, offline submit, reconnect drain, acknowledgement, wrong token, attachment pending/retry/READY, mobile viewport, HTTPS and direct routes; the Home offline reload and published route checks are already recorded as PASS. Second, obtain owner sign-off after reviewing the evidence. Only after the remaining matrix and sign-off pass should the owner change the decision to **READY FOR PHASE 2**.

## Owner action required

The remaining actions are environment-verification actions, not a request for product redesign. The owner must review the evidence and approve the remaining preview matrix before formal Phase 0/1 exit. Production malware scanning, retention, rate limiting, and staff bootstrap remain documented in `OWNER_ACTION_REQUIRED.md` and are not silently treated as implemented.
